Atoms ambient sound system... WHY NO ONE HAS MADE THIS BEFORE UH????

BeginAmbient - just starting to play a specific sound on the loop

StopAmbient - ... Should I really explain it?

		then it will use the current volume SETTING as the value.

	- increments: how many points there are between the starting volume and the ending
		volume. If too many points is creating lag, try reducing this number.
