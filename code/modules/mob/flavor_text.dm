/*
basically Baystation's character flavor text edited to work with /tg/ code.

flavor_text is loaded and saved for player savegames as part of DNA, in
	code\modules\client\preferences.dm
and can only be edited by players during character setup, in
	code\modules\client\preferences_savefile.dm

it is transfered from DNA to human mobs (on a carbon mob level) in
	code\datums\dna.dm
whenever needed.

the two main player-facing functionalities are:
	A) adding a short (with Topic-link) version of the text to human examine() output, in
		code\modules\mob\living\carbon\human\examine.dm

	B) showing the full text in a window via human Topic() call, in
		code\modules\mob\living\carbon\human\human.dm

in general these two functionalities could be added to any kind of mob's examine() and Topic(),
you would need to add a way (e.g. verb) for the mobs to set the text as they do not have access to the character setup screen,
but I am not sure you even want non-humans to have it (not even Bay does that), so no tragic backstory for cleanbots for now.
